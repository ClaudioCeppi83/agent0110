# Agente 0110 Project Progress Report

## Introduction

Agente 0110 is a project aimed at creating a user-friendly interface for interacting with language models through Ollama. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt, featuring a terminal-like environment for sending prompts to Ollama models and displaying their responses. The goal is to create a tool that simplifies the process of working with Ollama and its models, providing users with an intuitive and efficient way to generate text, explore different models, and manage their interactions.

## Work Completed

### Initial Setup and Environment Configuration

The initial phase involved setting up the development environment and addressing challenges related to the integration of `qtermwidget` (for the embedded terminal) and ensuring compatibility with the display server in the development environment. The primary issues were:

*   `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`: This was resolved by setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the project's root directory.
*   `qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display`: This was addressed by configuring Qt to use the `offscreen` platform plugin, enabling the application to run without a direct connection to an X11 display server.

Since a suitable `qtermwidget` for Qt6 was not readily available, the `pyte` library was integrated as an alternative terminal emulator, requiring the creation of a custom `PyteTerminal` widget to bridge `pyte` with PyQt.

### Core Feature Implementation

The core features of the Agente 0110 application have been successfully implemented:

#### M贸dulo 1: Interfaz Principal en PyQt

*   A main window (`MainWindow`) was created using PyQt, providing the application's primary interface.
*   The main window includes:
    *   Two terminal tabs (`logs_terminal` and `output_terminal`) for displaying application logs and Ollama responses, respectively. These terminals are implemented using the custom `PyteTerminal` widget.
    *   A prompt input area (`prompt_input`) allowing users to enter text prompts for the language model.
    *   A "Send" button (`send_button`) to trigger the prompt generation process.
    *   A model selection dropdown (`model_selector`) to allow users to choose the Ollama model to use for generating responses.
*   The GUI layout is organized using `QVBoxLayout` and `QHBoxLayout` for a clear and structured arrangement of elements.
*   Basic menu bar functionality with placeholders for "Modelos", "MCPs", and "Configuraci贸n" menus was added.

#### M贸dulo 2: Gesti贸n de Modelos Ollama

*   An `OllamaClient` class was implemented to handle communication with the Ollama command-line tool.
*   The `OllamaClient` includes a `list_models` method that executes `ollama list` and parses the output to retrieve a list of available model names.
*   The `MainWindow` uses the `OllamaClient` to populate the `model_selector` dropdown with the available models when the application starts.
*   The `MainWindow` includes an `on_model_changed` slot that is triggered when the user selects a different model in the dropdown. Currently, this slot logs the selected model to the console.

### Prompt Sending and Response Display

*   The `OllamaClient` class includes a `generate_response` method that takes a prompt and a model name as input, executes the `ollama run <model> <prompt>` command, captures the output (the generated response), and returns it as a string.
*   The `MainWindow` includes an `on_send_clicked` slot that is triggered when the user clicks the "Send" button.
*   The `on_send_clicked` slot retrieves the prompt text and selected model from the GUI elements, calls the `generate_response` method of the `OllamaClient` to get a response, and then displays the response in the `output_terminal` using its `write` method.

### Code Review and Refactoring

The codebase was reviewed and refactored to improve its organization, readability, and maintainability. This included:

*   Breaking down long methods into smaller, more focused methods (e.g., in `MainWindow.__init__`).
*   Adding more comments to clarify the purpose and logic of different code sections.
*   Using named constants for values like window geometry.
*   Ensuring consistent string formatting.
*   Improving error handling and string parsing in the `OllamaClient` class.

### Logging

Logging was added throughout the application to capture important events and aid in debugging. This includes logging for:

*   Application startup and GUI initialization.
*   Model selection changes.
*   Prompt sending and receiving.
*   Terminal input and output.
*   Ollama command execution and errors.

### Preparation for Future Development

The codebase was prepared for future development by:

*   Adding comments to improve understandability.
*   Organizing code into logical modules and classes.
*   Identifying potential areas for improvement and future features.

## Remaining Tasks and Future Improvements

Due to the limitations of the current environment, thorough testing of the application's GUI is not possible. However, based on the implemented functionality and the lack of runtime errors, the core features are believed to be working correctly.

The following tasks and improvements are identified for future development:

*   **Thorough Testing:** Once a suitable environment for GUI interaction is available, the application needs to be thoroughly tested to identify and fix any bugs or unexpected behavior.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms. This could include displaying error messages in the GUI, logging errors to a file, and providing more informative error messages to the user.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Explore using asynchronous operations (e.g., with `asyncio`) for interacting with Ollama. This would prevent the GUI from freezing while waiting for responses from the language model.
*   **Advanced Features:** Consider adding the following advanced features:
    *   **Multiple Conversations/Sessions:** Allow users to manage multiple conversations or sessions with different models or prompts.
    *   **Save/Load Prompts and Responses:** Implement functionality to save and load prompts, responses, and conversation history.
    *   **Customize Terminal Appearance:** Provide options for users to customize the appearance of the terminal widgets (e.g., colors, font).
    *   **Sophisticated Prompt Input:** Replace the basic `QTextEdit` with a more sophisticated text editor that supports features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and history.
    *   **MCP Integration:** Integrate with additional MCP (likely meaning "Model Control Parameters") functionalities, as described in the broader project context. This might involve adding options to configure model parameters or manage different types of interactions with Ollama.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** Continuously improve the user interface and user experience based on feedback and usage patterns.

## Current Status and Next Steps

The Agente 0110 project has reached a functional MVP stage. The core features of interacting with Ollama models through a PyQt-based GUI are implemented. Code quality has been improved through refactoring and the addition of logging. The project is now well-positioned for future development and expansion.

The next steps, when a suitable environment is available, would be to:

1.  Thoroughly test the application's GUI and core functionality.
2.  Address any bugs or issues identified during testing.
3.  Begin implementing the planned future improvements, starting with the most essential or high-impact features.
